## Motivation
In this project, my aim is to analyze the dataset showing the environmental impacts of companys. I find these topics especially important as sustainability is an important topic in today's world. By analyzing datasets, i aim to reach some results about business decisions and their effects on the environment.

## Data Source & Enrichment
- **Primary dataset:** [Open Access Dataset of Corporate Environmental Impacts](https://corporate-sustainability.org/an-open-access-dataset-of-corporate-environmental-impacts/) (≈13,000 firm-year observations, 2010-2018). This is a project that investigates the factors that affect corporate environmental impact by using data from firms that publicly list theirs.
- **Enrichment plan:** I am planning to collect and merge additional features such as;
  - Firm financial data (revenue, size, profitability),
  - Industry classification,
  - Country/regional indicators (e.g., GDP, regulations)
  , if possible.
